I'm trying to sort the list from simpler to more complex or time-consuming to fully understand, but this is highly subjective.

## Motivation and information

In my early animation experiences with [Processing](https://processing.org/), I came across captivating gifs by [beesandbombs (Dave)](https://beesandbombs.com/). Studying even a fraction of the [code he has shared](https://gist.github.com/beesandbombs) greatly enhanced my skills and approach. Over time, I've shared quite raw source codes from my animations, valuing visual outcome over code aesthetics. But with positive feedback and people asking me how the animations are made, I see value in sharing the code with more care.

This project compiles noteworthy animation source codes, aiming for clarity through commented code. It's a work in progress, aiming to surpass my previous releases despite the imperfections.

For newcomers or those seeking context, I recommend [**tutorials**](https://bleuje.com/tutorials/) on my website, especially the "[Replacement Technique](https://bleuje.com/tutorial4/)" and the one about beesandbombs' [motion blur template](https://bleuje.com/tutorial6/).

I hope this collection serves both those diving into Processing-based animations and the simply curious, potentially inspiring others just as beesandbombs inspired me.
